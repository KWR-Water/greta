Sutra2 is developed by KWR Water Research Institute. The code for omp removal 
is based on the original `Excel-based TRANSATOMIC program by Pieter Stuyfzand <https://library.kwrwater.nl/publication/59205490/>`_.
The code for microbial organism removal is based on the equations given in chapter 6.7 of 
BTO 2012.015 "Gezondheidsrisico's van fecale verontreiniging" [in Dutch], pp 71-74.
